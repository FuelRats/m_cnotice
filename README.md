# m_cnotice

This UnrealIRCd module is a custom module for the FuelRats IRC network that adds a number of commands to facilitate a live translation service in IRC

* /CNOTICE makes it possible to send a channel notice to a single a person, so that notices can be made to appear in a specific channel without sending it to the entire channel
* /MSGAS makes it possible to send a message while impersonating as another user, this command is written to be specifically restricted to a single user to avoid abuse
